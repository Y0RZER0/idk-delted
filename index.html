    <h4>- Choose your minecraft edition</h4>
    <p style="background-color: rgb(228, 229, 230);">There are 2 versions of Minecraft, Java edition and Bedrock edition.   On Bedrock you can play with any device like PC or laptop or even phone, This version is compatible to every device but got less feature.   And on java edition you can only play with PC (Computer, Laptop) This version got a few more feature but you won't be able to play cross-platfrom (can't play with friends on other device like phone, tablet)   The topic about edition is kinda sensitive, I hope i didn't start world war :)</p>

To attack kindly left click your mouse once then release (DONE, you just hitted 1 time) if you are trying to attack something (like cow, Kill it for meat) Go near them, Attack range is 3 blocks far, If you are further than that, You can't hit them.   To mine is same with attack, But you will need to hold left click (Aim at block, Press and hold left click.)

<p>Minecraft, I'm sure almost everyone have heard of this game. </p>
<p>Minecraft is a sandbox game where you can build creatively, Play with friend, Role playing, Gather resource to survive and a lot more!</p>  
<p>Minecraft got 3 main modes that is "Survival", "Creative" and "Hardcore". </p>
<p>In Survival mode you have to find food, gather resource and fence off monsters to survive.</p>
<p>In Creative mode you can fy around and build anything you want, maybe a house or a little farm or even THE WHOLE CASTLE.</p>
<p>In Hardcore mode, This mode is same with survival but you only got 1 life, If you die then you will turn into Spectator mode. In that mode you can fly around but can't do anything with the world (being like ghost, Can only Spectate but can't interact anymore)</p>
